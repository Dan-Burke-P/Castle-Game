# James likes card games
James has been playing card games for much of his life, and really considering the strategy in them.
Mostly card games like MTG or Hearthstone, James enjoys games that are of short to medium length where
the game itself is entirely determined by how the player's have chosen to play.  Synergies between cards
and combinations of techniques turn James' simple card games into a wonderland of creative opportunity.
When James begins to play 'Castle-Game' he gets excited, because it incorporates what he already loved
from his favorite card games, but also includes a more friendly enviornment for those who aren't willing
to spend hundreds of dollars collecting cards.  As well, James views this as a way to lure more of his
friends into the card-game world and wishes to play with them.
