/*
 * The BoardSlot class is used to encapsulate data related to a particular location on th eboard
 *
 * Since the board is broken into discrete locations on a 2-d plane we can use a 2-d
 * array of board slots to represent the board in question
 *
 * this way we can store not only unit data at a location but other properties
 * such as if a piece of terrain or a building intersects this slot we can link to the
 * other slots that it occupies
