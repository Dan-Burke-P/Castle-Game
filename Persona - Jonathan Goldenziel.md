## Casual Carl

Carl is a 30-year old gentleman who is running out of things to do while self-isolating and has decided to rediscover his love of gaming. 
In the past, Carl has enjoyed fantasy role-playing games such as the Legend of Zelda series and D&D, but now he wants to try something more 
strategic. This is his first real taste of the strategy genre, but he is willing to learn how this new game works if the game helps him figure 
things out. Above all else, Carl wants a way to relieve himself from the dreariness of his daily life, so he would like to feel immersed in 
a world that's completely different from his own.
